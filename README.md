Steps Done During Preprocessing:

1)Removing HTML tags using regular expresions.

2)Converting into lower case.

4)Removing Stopwords.


I have demonstrated two Vectorization Techniques:

1)Bag of words is used for vectorization.

2)tf IDF  vectorization.


I have trained both models using RandomForestClassifier with an accuaracy of 0.8087130696044066
