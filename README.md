Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral.

Dataset used to do the analysis was taken from Kaggle "IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews"

Steps Done During Preprocessing:

1)Removing HTML tags using regular expresions.

2)Converting into lower case.

3)Remove Punctuation.

4)Removing Stopwords.


I have demonstrated two Vectorization Techniques:

1)Bag of words is used for vectorization.

2)tf IDF  vectorization.


I have trained both models using RandomForestClassifier with an accuaracy of 0.8087130696044066
